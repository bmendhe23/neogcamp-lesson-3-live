        <h1>about neog camp</h1>
        <p>neoG Camp is a bootcamp that revives the learning for new(neo) generation(+G) programmers.
            It is a camp organised by Tanay Pratap sir which teaches you web dev over 6 months of time with a progressive learning that is by creating projects and not just mugging up the things you want to know.
        </p>
        <p>I must say this has been one of the best experiences of my coding journey. This blog is all about my experience and my journey through this camp.</p>

        <h2>my experience</h2>
        <p>Though I got to know about this camp late in mid-September but the complete experience of neog.camp is a nutshell is AWESOME!!! </p>

        <p>Since, I started late I thought that I won't be able to complete this on time. I almost thought of giving up in between but somehow I didn't, and I have finally completed <strong>levelZero.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>I will be submitting my portfolio for the <strong>levelOne</strong> today. I am writing this blog just before my submission. I am really excited now that I have completed levelZero.</p>

        <h2>what do I expect after my submission</h2>
        <p>To be honest, I am so happy that I didn't give up and completed the whole levelZero.</p>
        <p>There might be no seats left since I am submitting so late but the experience of doing levelZero projects has made everything worth it. </p>

        <p>Even if I don't get selected this time I will try for next time and give my best again and I will keep on learning more and more till then.</p>
