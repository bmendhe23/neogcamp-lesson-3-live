        <h1>this is my coding story</h1>
        <p>Let me be frank I did not knew something like this even existed because I was born and brought up in a
            defense family and the only career I ever thought of was being a Army Officer.</p>
        <p>This is until I passed my 10th standard and got to know about IIT-JEE. This is where it all started and
            talking about the start, it was the worst start in programming I could have xD. While the start was worst, I
            managed to make the ending of my boards somewhat good.</p>

        <h2>here I am a under-grad now</h2>
        <p>This is the part where I learn most of the programming and I start enjoying programming.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote"><em>"Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.” ― Roy T. Bennett</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I did something in a similar way. My failures consisted of not understanding what was going on to what should
            I do next. It was not very hard to get overwhelmed my everything in the starting. But, as they say practice
            makes you perfect, I simply followed my course and saw improvement in my problem solving. This pushed me to
            learn more.</p>

        <p>I somehow managed to learn things and also taught my juniors the same when they came to me. It is a wholesome
            experience to learn new things. It has been some time since I have coded as I was preparing for my MCA
            entrance.</p>

        <h2>the journey starts again...</h2>
        <p>Now, I am a student of NIT, Tiruchirappalli and I am at this very moment when I am writing this blog and
            learning web development from Tanay sir and it has been very interesting so far.</p>
        <p>The journey of my coding has started again with my masters and I plan to learn a lot more great things in the
            coming future.</p>

                creative people.” – Leo Burnett</em></blockquote>

        <p>Hope you all liked the blog. Please let me know if I should write more of them and keep on documenting my
            journey as I learn more things.</p>
